[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/jackson-network-jupyterlite/)

This repo uses a JupyterLite template from [Jupyterlite Demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo). It deploys a Jackson Queuing Network as a static site to GitHub Pages, adapted from a [Tom Monks jackson-network repository](https://github.com/TomMonks/jackson-network)

## ✨ Try it in your browser ✨

➡️ **https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/jackson-network-jupyterlite/**

Use the existing datafiles in the data folder 

You can upload or drag in a new data file and update the filepath to run the queuing network with new parameters. 

Code can be changed and run in the browser. Changes will persist in the browser cache until it is cleared. 

## Deploy your JupyterLite website on GitHub Pages
