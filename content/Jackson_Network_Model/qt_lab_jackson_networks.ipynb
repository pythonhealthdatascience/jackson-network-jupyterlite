    "# An open Jackson Network Model for health services\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jackson Queuing Network is a model used in queuing theory to analyze systems with multiple interconnected queues, where items (e.g. patients) move between service nodes in the network. Each node represents a server (or group of servers, such as beds in a ward), and the network models the flow and queuing of items as they receive service at each node. These networks are commonly used to model complex systems such as healthcare systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Arrival process: Jobs arrive at different nodes, with external arrivals following a Poisson distribution. Internal transitions between nodes also happen probabilistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Service process: Each node has a service rate, and jobs are served on a first-come, first-served basis, with service times exponentially distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Routing: After being served at a node, items may move to another node within the network or leave the system, following predetermined routing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Traffic equations: The arrival rate at each node is determined by both external arrivals and traffic from other nodes. These are calculated using the \"traffic equations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Performance metrics: Key performance metrics include average queue lengths, waiting times, and throughput at each node. These can be determined analytically for Jackson networks, and are common performance metrics in queuing theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Utilization**: ($\\rho$)\n",
    "     - Represents the system's utilization, i.e., the fraction of time the server is busy. A utilization of 0.5 means the server is busy 50% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Average Number in Queue**: ($L_q$)\n",
    "     - The average number of items (e.g., customers or patients) waiting in the queue. A value of 0.5 means, on average, there is half a person or item waiting in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. **Average Number in System**: ($L_s$)\n",
    "     - The average number of items in the entire system (both waiting and being served). A value of 1.0 means, on average, there is one item in the system (either waiting or being served).\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. **Average Time in System**: ($W_s$)\n",
    "     - The average time an item spends in the system, including both waiting and service time. A value of 0.2 might represent 0.2 units of time (e.g., hours or minutes) that a job or person spends from arrival to departure.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. **Average Time in Queue**: ($W_q$S)\n",
    "     - The average waiting time in the queue before service. A value of 0.1 might indicate that, on average, a job waits 0.1 units of time before being served.\n",

An unstable system, where traffic intensity $ \\rho $ >1, poses several issues that make traditional queuing models, like the Jackson Queuing Network, unsuitable for analysis in their standard form. Such systems result in infinite queue lengths and unbounded waiting times, violating the key assumption of a steady state. To manage or avoid instability, systems need to be stabilized by adjusting service capacity, service rates, or arrival rates. Alternatively, transient analysis or simulations can be used to model such systems over finite periods.  \n"
